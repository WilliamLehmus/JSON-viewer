I find it hard to read bigger JSON files, they can get complex and messy to view and frankly I don't trust many of the public JSON viewers online as they often require you to accept hundreds of cookies. 
So I created a quick open source JSON viewer that doesn't use any cookies, save, collect or share data and that can be run locally (just save the html file on your computer and run it locally).
